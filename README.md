# Arduino-code-for-UTeM-donkey-car
This project provide an Arduino sketch to code the motor driver, servo, dc motor  and ESC 

1) Motor driver (L298N Dual H-Bridge): 
  H-Bridge's are typically used in controlling motors speed and direction. An H-Bridge is a circuit that can drive a current in               either polarity and be controlled by *Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

2) Servo: 
  Servo motor will rotate from 0 degrees to 180 degrees, one degree at a time using Servo library.

3)Dc motor
  A 'brushed' DC motor is an internally commutated electric motor designed to be run from a direct current power source. 

4) ESC (electronic speed controller):
  ESC are used to control 'brushless' motors. This sketch is based on the Servo library that allows controling servo-motors sending them a   50Hz servo-control signal (a particular kind of PWM).
