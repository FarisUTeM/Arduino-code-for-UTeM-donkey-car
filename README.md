This project provide an Arduino sketch to code the motor driver, servo, and ESC 

1) Motor driver (L298N Dual H-Bridge): 
   Motor driver are used to control a brushed DC motor. H-Bridge's are typically used in controlling motors speed and direction. An H-        Bridge is a circuit that can drive a current in either polarity and be controlled by *Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

2) Servo: 
  Servo motor will rotate from 0 degrees to 180 degrees, one degree at a time using Servo library.

3) ESC (electronic speed controller):
  ESC are used to control 'brushless' motors. This sketch is based on the Servo library that allows controling servo-motors sending them a   50Hz servo-control signal (a particular kind of PWM).
